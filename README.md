New Shoes is an Android app for runners to track the amount of miles they accumulate in a given pair of shoes, in order to be notified when it's time to buy a new pair. 


## Installation

## Usage
### Adding a Shoe
Upon first opening the app, the user must add a new shoe to the list. To do this, simply click the "Add Shoe" button, which will take you to the add shoe screen. From there, you add the name of your shoes (Nike Air, Adiddas, etc.), and the amount of miles you wish to run in them before buying a new pair. After adding the required info, click "Add" to return to the main screen.


### Selecting a Shoe
To select a shoe, click the dropdown menu to display the alphabetically sorted list of shoes you have added. In this list you will see the names of your shoes and the amount of miles you've ran in them so far. If a shoe has reached or surpassed the amount of miles you entered, you will see a shoe emoji next to the name of the shoe to indicate that it is time to buy a new pair. Simply click the name of the shoes you plan to run in, so that it is selected in the drop box. If the shoe you've selected has reached it's mile limit, you will receive a notification on the screen to inform you that it's time to get a new pair of shoes. Next, click the "Start Run" button to be taken to the run-tracking screen.


### Starting a Run
Once you are at the run-tracking screen, simply tap the "Go" button to begin tracking your miles. As you run, the green progress bar will begin to fill up to provide a visual indication of how close you are to reaching your mile-limit. Should you need to pause tracking for any reason, click the "Pause Run" button. After clicking pause, the button turns into a "Continue Run" button. Whenever you are ready to continue your run, click continue and mile tracking will resume. At any point during your run, if you reach your mile-limit, you will receive a brief notification to inform you that it's now time to get a new pair of shoes. Whenever you are ready to end you run, tap the "End Run" button. This will add all of the miles to your shoe, and take you back to the main screen.

### Editing a Shoe
If you entered something wrong while adding the shoe the first time, or you forgot to track one of your runs and you need to add miles, simply select the shoe from the list and click the "Edit Shoe" button on the main screen. At the edit shoe screen you will be presented with three fields to edit, feel free to edit only the fields you wish and leave the rest blank. Once you are done editing, click the "Save Changes" button to return to the main screen. If you got here by mistake, simply tap cancel to return to the main screen.

### Deleting a Shoe
If for whatever reason you wish to delete a shoe altogether, simply select the shoe from the list and click "Delete Shoe". Upon successful deletion you will receive a notification to inform you that your shoe has been deleted. If you accidentally delete a shoe by mistake, long-press the "Delete Shoe" button and your shoe will be restored to the list. Note: if you delete a shoe and then close the app, you will not be able to undo the deletion once you re-open.
