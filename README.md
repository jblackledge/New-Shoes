## Usage
### Adding a Shoe
Upon first opening the app, the user must add a new shoe to the list. To do this, simply click the "Add Shoe" button, which will take you to the add shoe screen. From there, you add the name of your shoes (Nike Air, Adiddas, etc.), and the amount of miles you wish to run in them before buying a new pair. After adding the required info, click "Add" to return to the main screen.


### Selecting a Shoe
To select a shoe, click the dropdown menu to display the alphabetically sorted list of shoes you have added. In this list you will see the names of your shoes and the amount of miles you've ran in them so far. If a shoe has reached or surpassed the amount of miles you entered, you will see a shoe emoji next to the name of the shoe to indicate that it is time to buy a new pair. Simply click the name of the shoes you plan to run in, so that it is selected in the drop box. If the shoe you've selected has reached it's mile limit, you will receive a notification on the screen to inform you that it's time to get a new pair of shoes. Next, click the "Start Run" button to be taken to the run-tracking screen.


### Starting a Run
Once you are at the run-tracking screen, simply tap the "Go" button to begin tracking your miles. As you run, the green progress bar will begin to fill up to provide a visual indication of how close you are to reaching your mile-limit. Should you need to pause tracking for any reason, click the "Pause Run" button. After clicking pause, the button turns into a "Continue Run" button. Whenever you are ready to continue your run, click continue and mile tracking will resume. At any point during your run, if you reach your mile-limit, you will receive a brief notification to inform you that it's now time to get a new pair of shoes. Whenever you are ready to end you run, tap the "End Run" button. This will add all of the miles to your shoe, and take you back to the main screen.
